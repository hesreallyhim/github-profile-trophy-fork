Trophy,Current Calculation,Issue/Limitation,Proposed Enhancement,Feasibility,Justification
Stars,Total stars across all repos,"Doesn't account for repo age, quality, or distribution. One viral repo can dominate.","Option A: Stars per year of account age (velocity metric). Option B: Weighted by repo count (average stars/repo). Option C: Log-scale: log10(1 + stars) to compress outliers.","High - uses existing data","Stars are time-dependent (older accounts have advantage) and distribution matters (1000 stars across 10 repos shows more consistent quality than 1000 stars in 1 repo). Velocity normalizes for account age."
Commits,Total commits (public + private),"Quantity over quality. Doesn't distinguish between 1-line commits and substantial work. No recency weighting.","Option A: Commits per year (velocity). Option B: Hybrid with recent activity bonus (e.g., 1.2x weight for commits in last year). Option C: Keep as-is with clearer thresholds.","Medium - would need contributionsCollection.contributionYears data for velocity","Commit counts are gamed easily (small commits). However, changing this might penalize legitimate users. Recency bonus rewards active developers. **Recommendation: Keep as-is** - it measures lifetime contribution volume adequately."
Followers,Total follower count,"Doesn't measure influence quality. No context about follower engagement or following ratio.","Option A: Add percentile-based ranking if global data available. Option B: Keep fixed thresholds but normalize by account age (followers/year). Option C: Keep as-is.","Low for percentile (needs database), High for normalization","Followers accumulate over time, so older accounts have advantage. However, popular users gain followers quickly. **Recommendation: Keep as-is** - follower count is a reasonable absolute metric of reach."
Issues,Total issues (open + closed),"Doesn't distinguish between opened issues (bug reports/requests) vs closed issues (resolutions). Open issues might indicate lack of follow-through.","Option A: Weighted formula: (closedIssues * 1.0 + openIssues * 0.7) to slightly penalize many open issues. Option B: Track issue resolution rate separately (closedIssues/totalIssues) as quality metric. Option C: Keep as-is.","High - data already available","Issue quality matters. Someone who opens 1000 issues but closes 10 shows different behavior than someone who closes 900/1000. However, many open issues in active projects is normal. **Recommendation: Option B** - add resolution rate as separate metric or modifier."
Pull Requests,Total PRs,"Doesn't distinguish merged vs closed vs open PRs. PR acceptance rate matters for contribution quality.","Option A: Weighted formula to reward merged PRs more. Requires additional API field (PR state). Option B: Add PR acceptance rate trophy. Option C: Keep as-is but acknowledge limitation.","Medium - requires API change to fetch PR states","PR acceptance rate is crucial for measuring contribution quality. However, this would require fetching PR states for up to 1000s of PRs. **Recommendation: Option C** - keep as-is due to API cost, but document that this measures volume not acceptance."
Repositories,Total repository count,"Heavily penalizes quality over quantity. Someone with 100 empty repos ranks same as 100 quality repos. Very tight high-end progression (80→90→100).","Option A: Weight by repo activity (repos with stars > 0, or commits in last year). Option B: Use 'quality repo count' (repos with 3+ stars OR 5+ commits). Option C: Fix progression (SSS=100→120, SS=90→100, S=80→80).","High for progression fix, Medium for weighted formula","Empty/abandoned repos shouldn't count equally. Current top ranks are too compressed. **Recommendation: Option A + C** - weight by activity AND fix progression to 80→100→120 for S/SS/SSS."
Reviews,Total PR review contributions,"Current thresholds seem arbitrary (57? 45?). Irregular progression suggests ad-hoc tuning.","Option A: Smooth progression with consistent multiplier (C=1, B=4, A=10, AA=25, AAA=60, S=150, SS=350, SSS=800). Option B: Keep thresholds but add review depth metric (reviews with comments vs approvals). Option C: Standardize to doubling pattern.","High for threshold adjustment, Medium for depth metric","The irregular thresholds suggest these weren't calculated systematically. **Recommendation: Option C** - use consistent doubling: C=1, B=3, A=6, AA=12, AAA=25, S=50, SS=100, SSS=200."
Experience,Account age in hundred-day units,"**BUG**: Divides by 100 making thresholds confusing. Comments don't match actual values. Scale factor seems arbitrary.","Option A: Remove /100 divisor and update thresholds to actual days (C=50, B=548, A=1095, AA=1826, AAA=2738, S=3652, SS=5478, SSS=7304). Option B: Keep /100 but fix comments and documentation. Option C: Use years directly (durationYear) with decimal ranks.","High - simple fix","The /100 divisor creates confusion. Either remove it and use days, or make it explicit that score is in '100-day units'. **Recommendation: Option A** - use actual days with clear thresholds (e.g., SSS = 20 years = 7304 days)."
MultiLanguage,Count of unique languages,"Treats all languages equally. JavaScript + TypeScript counted separately but are similar. Doesn't weight by actual usage (lines of code).","Option A: Weight by language 'size' (bytes) available in API per repo. Option B: Group similar languages (JS/TS, C/C++). Option C: Use Shannon entropy for diversity. Option D: Keep as-is.","Medium - would need to fetch language sizes","Language diversity is interesting but raw count is crude. However, weighting adds complexity. **Recommendation: Option A** - use language size data already in API to measure 'substantive' language diversity (ignore languages with <1% of codebase)."
AllSuperRank,All base trophies S-rank+,"Very difficult to achieve (requires excellence across all 7 dimensions). Binary outcome (SECRET or nothing).","Option A: Add tiered achievement (Bronze=5/7 S-rank, Silver=6/7, Gold=7/7 all S-rank). Option B: Add 'Almost There' rank showing progress. Option C: Keep as-is (aspirational goal).","High - logic change only","Current binary system is harsh. Showing progress encourages users. However, SECRET trophies are meant to be rare. **Recommendation: Option C** - keep as-is, it's meant to be an elite achievement."
Organizations,Count of organizations,"Raw count doesn't measure involvement level. Being in 100 orgs isn't necessarily better than 3 active ones.","Option A: Keep as-is (measures breadth of collaboration). Option B: Track contributions per org (but requires complex API). Option C: Increase threshold to 5+ orgs.","High for threshold change","Organization membership primarily measures professional network breadth. Activity per org is too complex to track. **Recommendation: Option A** - keep as-is, 3+ orgs is reasonable measure of collaboration."
Ancient User,Account created ≤2010,Binary threshold is arbitrary (why 2010?),Option A: Keep as-is (historical milestone). Option B: Make it rolling (10+ years old). Option C: Merge with LongTimeUser.,"High - logic only","2010 represents 'early GitHub era' (before widespread adoption). It's intentionally historical. **Recommendation: Option A** - keep as-is, it's a historical badge."
OG User,Account created ≤2008,Binary threshold (GitHub founding year),Keep as-is - this is perfect. 2008 is GitHub's founding year.,"N/A","No changes needed. This correctly honors GitHub's founding users."
Joined 2020,Account created in 2020 exactly,"Arbitrary year choice. Will become less relevant over time. Unlike Ancient/OG which gain prestige, this loses relevance.","Option A: Remove trophy (low value). Option B: Make it 'Joined in COVID year' with context. Option C: Add similar trophies for other milestone years. Option D: Keep as commemorative badge.","High - could remove","2020 was significant (COVID-19, GitHub growth surge). However, this trophy will seem arbitrary in 10 years. **Recommendation: Option B** - rename/reframe as COVID-era badge OR Option A - remove as it provides little value."
Long Time User,Account age ≥10 years,"Overlaps with Experience trophy. Naming confusing (less exclusive than 'Ancient' despite similar concept). Redundant with AccountDuration.","Option A: Remove trophy (redundant with Experience). Option B: Increase threshold to 15 years. Option C: Keep as mid-tier between modern and ancient users.","High - could remove","This trophy is redundant. Experience trophy already measures duration across ranks. **Recommendation: Option A** - remove this trophy, it duplicates Experience functionality."
AccountDuration,Account age in hundred-day units (multiple ranks),"Same /100 bug as Experience trophy. Listed as 'secret' but has standard ranks (C-SSS). Redundant with Experience trophy name.","Option A: Remove (duplicate of Experience). Option B: Differentiate purpose (Experience=rank progression, AccountDuration=specific milestones). Option C: Keep but fix /100 bug.","High - could merge","This appears to be a duplicate of Experience trophy. **Recommendation: Option A** - merge into Experience trophy as they measure the same thing."
